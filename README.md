# Practicing Power BI: Analyzing Churned Customers at a Telephone Company

## Introduction
This project was undertaken to gain practical experience with Power BI. It involves the analysis of churned customers' data from a telephone company, which was originally used for the final bootcamp project in Tableau (re: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/soichi-berson/final_bootcamp_project)). I have now replicated the analysis using Power BI.

## Project
**Theme:** Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

The analysis is based on data from Kaggle ([Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)).

## Materials
- **Files:** Power BI file, raw data, PDF
- **Screenshots:** a screenshot of Power BI pages

This is the README. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further information.
